The theme is VERY loud and making music levels on that theme is usually inferior compared to making them on the first 3 themes, and most ideas for a gimmick for a level usually can be also replicated in the other themes too. Not wanting to make a wall-jump/ground-pound cancel level, I decided to make this 'easy', running through the level 'traditional-style'. NSMBU is perfect for a Traditional level, and Underground is such a beautiful course theme.",
